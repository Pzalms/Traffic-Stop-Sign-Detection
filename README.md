# Road Sign Detection using Yolov5

So you want to detection traffice signs hey? Well fear not...you can do this...I believe in you. But also, the code is below 😉. This notebook walks you through downloading the dataset from @andrewmvd's collection, converting the annotations from Pascal VOC to YOLO and last but not least rendering the bounding boxes within your Notebook using OpenCV and Matplotlib. Happy Coding ✌️
